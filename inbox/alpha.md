In trading, there is a long tradition of using technical indicators to generate, based on
observed patterns, buy or sell signals. Such technical indicators, basically of any kind,
can also be used as features for the training of neural networks.

Technical Indicators as Features
As the preceding examples show, basically any traditional technical
indicator used for investing or intraday trading can be used as a
feature to train ML algorithms. In that sense, AI and ML do not
necessarily render such indicators obsolete, rather they can indeed
enrich the ML-driven derivation of trading strategies.
